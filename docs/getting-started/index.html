<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h2>Installing the plugin</h2>
1. Download the latest release <a href="https://github.com/WasabiThumb/xplug/releases/latest" target="_blank">from GitHub</a> or SpigotMC. Do not use the JAR labelled "original" unless you know what you are doing.



2. Place the JAR into the "plugins" directory of your server. Run the server at least once if you want to modify configuration and scripts.



<h2>Using the plugin</h2>
Use /xplug run [name] to run a LUA project, or /xplug exec [code] to run a line of custom LUA code. The plugin ships with <a href="https://github.com/WasabiThumb/xplug#sample-scripts" target="_blank">a few sample projects</a> you can run.
A full list of commands can be found <a href="https://github.com/WasabiThumb/xplug#commands" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.



Example:
Tells you the number of players online
<code lang="lua">
/xplug exec return #server.GetPlayers()
</code>



<h2>Creating your own LUA project</h2>
To make a new project, enter "/plugins/XPlug/" from your server's root directory. Then, enter "scripts" if you want your project to be a normal callable routine (e.g. /xclaim run project) or "autorun" if you want it to start directly after the plugin is enabled.



From here, either create a .lua file with the name of your project, or a folder with the name of your project and an index.lua inside of that folder. The index.lua is called when you run your project, and having it in a folder is useful if your project contains multiple LUA files (not yet properly supported but planned).



Then you can start coding! This can be done even when the server is running since LUA projects are interpreted when called. Check out the <a href="/xplug/lua-api">LUA API Overview</a> for info on useful libraries, hooks, etc.



<h2>Adding to your plugin</h2>
XPlug is not currently hosted on any Maven repository, so you will have to add the JAR as a system dependency. Then, refer to the <a href="/xplug/java-api">Java API Overview</a> to get started.
